## 🚀 Starting

This repository contains all [the solved exercises](https://github.com/mateusadada/ipo-udesc/tree/main/solved_exercises) from Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming course of second semester. The exercises have more complex and challenging concepts, as well as the use of classes. It was fundamental to improve my knowledge in this language and it also helped with my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/).

[The final project](https://github.com/mateusadada/ipo-udesc/tree/main/final_project) was a presentation of a calculator developed by me in Python. I created basic functions, and graphical style was not used due to my lack of knowledge at the time. I separated each function into a different file to facilitate maintenance and make the code more readable. I also performed various validations to prevent typing errors. To use it, you should run the [main.py](https://github.com/mateusadada/ipo-udesc/blob/main/final_project/main.py) code.

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of exercises and the final project:

- Tuples.
- Lists.
- Functions.
- Basic concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic linking, methods, messages, abstraction, encapsulation and reuse.
- Generalization and specialization.
- Project design, notions and implementation.

## 📋 Prerequisites
